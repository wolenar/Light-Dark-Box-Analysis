DESCRIPTION
Analyzes raw data from MedAssociates software and returns individual mouse behavior means, strain behavior means and strain behavior SEM (sd/sqrt(n-1)). 

ARGUMENTS
data
location of .csv file containing raw LD box data. 

plot
logical; if TRUE, barplots of analyzed data are plotted by calling ril.barplot function. 

export.raw
logical; if TRUE, input file is exported along with analyzed results. This is useful if input data time columns are in MedAssociates bizarre format, as these will be converted to seconds before exporting. 

DETAILS
Adding an extra column to the input data labeled as "INCLUDE" with a TRUE/FALSE value for each mice will inform the script which should be excluded from the analysis. 

If plot is set to true barplots with SEM error bars are exported for each behavior at both time points. P-values from sal vs etoh t.test are also calculated and displayed.

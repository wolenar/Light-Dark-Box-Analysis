# Requires Strain & Treatment columns

# Arguments
############
# pheno: columname that contains pheno data to be plotted
# factor: columnname that contains factor used to group strains
#			 (e.g. factor="Treatment")
# sort: Strain or factor
# x.rot: Logical, rotate x-axis annotations?
# y.lab: y-axis label
# x.lab: x-axis label
# percent: Logical, is y-axis in percentages
# sig.test: logical, compute t-tests and add sig markers?
# by: vector of grouping elements (column names)
# fill: Fill or no fill bars based on this binary factor.
#		Provide column index number or name
# bar.col: vector of colors to differentiate factor levels
#				(e.g., bar.cols=c("blue","red"))
#           (or, aaron.cols)
#ril.barplot(data=all.bxd, pheno="DTL", sort="pvalue")


# Version 1.2
# (DONE) Intelligently determine proper y-axis size
# (DONE) Intelligently identify factors instead of forcing sal/etoh labels
# (DONE) Remove requirement for gplots by manually drawing error bars

# Known issues
# currently can only handle 1 factor with 2 levels
